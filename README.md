# React Curves 

huge thanks to kevin powell on curvaceous tutorial! i will leave details to video and channel below, be sure to go and subscribe!

In this repository, My goal was to practice more CSS. And to my surprise, the CSS was coded directly into an HTML file! this is my first time seeing this method being used. I was always taught to separate concerns, I do understand as to why he took this approach. At the beginning of the tutorial he stated that he wanted to show that it was indeed possible to code in this way, I guess for whomever was wondering.

I would like to challenge myself here, Although not much of a challenge. I would like to convert this into jsx instead of all the code on one HTML file. This will be simple in ways, I am sure I'll run into issues. Maybe not but it is better to expect than it be unexpected.

(by the way, my apologies for the delay in weekly repository, working on 3-4 different projects at once. The other 3 projects I am working on have set deadlines, I am still working on all 4, but I made time daily to code a bit in this repository.)

Expect to see Some of these features in my Major Project at the end of February.
